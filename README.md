# Digit Recognizer

I got to know about this project from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
The goal of this model is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.

While doing this project I learnt about various aspects of preprocessing and ML model building.
One of the most interesting things I learnt here is 'Image Augmentation'

The project is still under process and has some issues, I will be resolving them asap.
