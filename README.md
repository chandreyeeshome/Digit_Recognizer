## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately classify images of digits (0-9) by learning from a vast dataset of labeled handwritten digits.

This model achieves a high validation accuracy and is trained using various image preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance its performance. The repository includes scripts for training the model, testing its performance, and visualizing predictions.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```

├── Digit_Recognizer.ipynb     # Notebook for the whole process
├── digit_recognizer.py        # Script for the whole process
├── model.h5                   # Saved model
├── test.csv                   # Training dataset
├── train.csv                  # Testing dataset

```

## Data

The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 42,000 training images and 28,000 test images of handwritten digits, each labeled with a corresponding digit from 0 to 9. The images are grayscale and have a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

## Model Architecture

The model implemented is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), designed to handle the spatial structure of image data efficiently. The architecture includes:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
- Fully connected layers to perform classification based on the extracted features.

This combination allows the model to capture the relevant patterns and characteristics of handwritten digits, leading to high classification accuracy.

## Training the Model

- Loads the training data from `train.csv`.
- Preprocesses the data by normalizing pixel values.
- Augments the data to improve generalization.
- Compiles the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
- Trains the model over a set number of epochs, saving the best model weights.

## Testing the Model

- Loads the test data from `test.csv`.
- Preprocesses the data similarly to the training set.
- Uses the trained model to predict labels for the test images.

## Previewing Predictions

 Allows you to visualize a random selection of 40 test images along with their predicted labels. This can be useful for understanding how the model performs on individual samples.

## Image Augmentation

One of the key techniques employed in this project is image augmentation. This involves creating variations of the training images through transformations such as rotation, scaling, and shifting. Augmentation helps the model generalize better by exposing it to a wider variety of image variations during training.

## Requirements

The project requires Python 3 and several Python libraries. The key dependencies include:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
